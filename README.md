## Features

- **Voice Commands:** Interact with the virtual assistant using natural language voice commands.
  
- **ChatGPT Integration:** Utilizes ChatGPT to process and respond to user voice commands intelligently.

- **DALL-E Image Generation:** Enhances the app's capabilities by integrating DALL-E for on-the-fly image generation based on user interactions.

- **Beautiful UI:** A user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing user interface designed using Flutter.

## Overcoming ChatGPT Limitations

ChatGPT is primarily a text generation model. To overcome this limitation and provide a more immersive experience, DALL-E, an AI image generation tool, is seamlessly integrated into the app. This allows the virtual assistant not only to generate text-based responses but also to create unique images based on user input and preferences.

## Uses

- **Task Automation:** Perform various tasks using voice commands, such as setting reminders, searching the web, or sending messages.

- **Image Generation:** Generate unique images through DALL-E based on user input and preferences.
